# Electrostatic Boundary Problem Solver

This is a webapp that can solve 2D Electrostatic Boundary Problems in real time and was created so that I could learn ReactJS ðŸ˜ƒ The project is hosted on Firebase and can be found [here](https://relaxation-webapp.web.app/) so check it out!

As this is project is based off of research from one of my Uni courses I've included the technical report about the algorithm's used and why Successive Over Relaxation is so efficient that it can be ran in the browser in a reasonable time and (rather than only in C++). The report also delves into why I chose to implement Lagrange Interpolation for the edges of the grid and circumstances when it should be used.
